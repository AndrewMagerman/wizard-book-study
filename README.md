# WizardBookStudy - Planning/DRAFT

Let's study the Wizard book together.


The Wizard book (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, a.k.a SICP)
is the book that is used for teaching CS at Berkeley and Stanford Universities.
It's a challenging read, introducing many fundamental concepts, and not for the
faint of heart. It's one of these rare books where the reviews on Amazon are
either 5 or one star. Love it or hate it.

> First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a  
> way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel 
> formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology.
> Thus, **programs must be written for people to read**, and only incidentally
> for machines to execute.
> Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject
> at this level is not
> the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever
> algorithms for computing particular
> functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and
> the foundations of computing,
> but rather **the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity 
> of large software systems**.


I tried to self-study about 5 years ago, but my brain froze around the middle,
so this is why I'm organizing a group study, in the hope that peer pressure, and
our combined brainpower will help us stay on course.

The excellent website https://teachyourselfcs.com/ suggests using
[Brian Harvey's SICP lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)
and that is what we will follow there. I tried the MIT lectures but found them
difficult.

The idea is: we study individually, but on an agreed schedule (i.e. watch
Lectures 1,2,3 and do homework XXX, and have a regular online meetup where we
exchange our issues and help each other.

We will do the exams!



## Schedule

TBD

Kickstarter/First Meeting: First week of March

- no meetings during official swiss school holidays
- Pace: probably twice a month
- Timing: probably on one week evening, like Wed evening at 1800, duration
  45mins max.

## Infrastructure

Chat: Coder's only discord chat

Meetings via Meetup

- Advertisement through Coders Only newsletter

## Members which have indicated interest:

Felix Isensee 

Pablo Verges 

Matthias Osswald

## What should I expect?

It's about 100 to 200 hours of work.

## Getting Started

### Buy the book

**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, second edition**

Abelson, HaroldSussman, Gerald JaySussman, Julie

https://www.buchhaus.ch/de/detail/ISBN-9780262510875/Abelson-Harold/Structure-and-Interpretation-of-Computer-Programs-second-edition?bpmctrl=bpmrownr.1%7Cforeign.490271-1-0-0

alternatively you can read
it [online](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

### Install Racket

https://racket-lang.org/download/

and also install simply-scheme:

type `(require (planet dyoo/simply-scheme:2:2))` in the interpreter


from:
http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=simply-scheme.plt&owner=dyoo

JetBrains Products have a Racket syntax highlighter!!!
