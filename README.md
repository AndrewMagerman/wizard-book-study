# WizardBookStudy

Let's study the Wizard book together.

![Wizard book picture](resources/Wizard-book-meetup.png)

The Wizard book (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, a.k.a SICP)
is the book that is used for teaching CS at Berkeley and Stanford Universities. It's a challenging read, introducing
many fundamental concepts, and not for the faint of heart. It's one of these rare books where the reviews on Amazon are
either 5 or one star. Love it or hate it.

Here is an excerpt of the preface which I found particularly arresting:

> First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a  
> way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
> formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology.
> Thus, **programs must be written for people to read**, and only incidentally
> for machines to execute.
> Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject
> at this level is not
> the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever
> algorithms for computing particular
> functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and
> the foundations of computing,
> but rather **the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity
> of large software systems**.


I tried to self-study about 5 years ago, but my brain froze around the middle, so this is why I'm organizing a group
study, in the hope that peer pressure, and our combined brainpower will help us stay on course.

The excellent website https://teachyourselfcs.com/ suggests using
[Brian Harvey's SICP lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)
and that is what we will follow there. I tried the MIT lectures but found them difficult.

The idea is: we study individually, but on an agreed schedule (i.e. watch Lectures 1,2,3 and do homework XXX), and have
a regular online meetup where we exchange our issues and help each other. Provisionally the schedule is every two weeks,
but we'll see what pace is comfortable/sustainable.

We will do the exams! (not the official ones)
