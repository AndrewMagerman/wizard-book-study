    WORD AND SENTENCE MANIPULATION PROCEDURES

    The first chapter of the textbook deals exclusively with numeric data.
    To allow some variety, with interesting examples that aren't about
    calculus, we are going to use some additional Scheme procedures that
    manipulate linguistic data: words and sentences.  A word can be
    considered as a string of characters, such as letters and digits.
    (Numbers can be treated as words.)  A sentence is a string of words
    in parentheses.


    PROCEDURES TO TAKE APART WORDS AND SENTENCES:

    FIRST	    returns the first character of a word, or
		    the first word of a sentence

    BUTFIRST	    returns all but the first character of a word,
		    or all but the first word of a sentence

    BF		    same as BUTFIRST

    LAST	    returns the last character of a word, or
		    the last word of a sentence

    BUTLAST	    returns all but the last character of a word,
		    or all but the last word of a sentence

    BL		    same as BUTLAST

    Examples:

    > (first 'hello)
    h

    > (butlast '(symbolic data are fun))
    (symbolic data are)


    PROCEDURES TO COMBINE WORDS AND SENTENCES

    WORD	    arguments must be words; returns the word with
		    all the arguments strung together

    SENTENCE	    returns the sentence with all the arguments
		    (words or sentences) strung together

    SE		same as SENTENCE

    Examples:

    > (word 'now 'here)
    nowhere

    > (se 'lisp '(is cool))
    (lisp is cool)

    PREDICATE PROCEDURES

    EQUAL?	    returns true if its two arguments are the same word
		    or the same sentence (a one-word sentence is not
		    equal to the word inside it)

    MEMBER?	    returns true if the first argument is a member of
		    the second; the members of a word are its letters
		    and the members of a sentence are its words

    EMPTY?	    returns true if the argument is either the empty
		    word [which can be represented as "" ] or the
		    empty sentence [which can be represented as '() ]



    MISCELLANEOUS

    COUNT	    returns the number of letters in the argument word, or
		    the number of words in the argument sentence.

    ITEM	    takes two arguments: a positive integer N, and a word or
		    sentence; returns the Nth letter of the word, or the Nth
		    word of the sentence (counting from 1).



    Examples:

    (define (buzz n)
      (cond ((member? 7 n) 'buzz)
	    ((= (remainder n 7) 0) 'buzz)
	    (else n) ))

    (define (plural wd)
      (if (equal? (last wd) 'y)
	  (word (bl wd) 'ies)
	  (word wd 's) ))
