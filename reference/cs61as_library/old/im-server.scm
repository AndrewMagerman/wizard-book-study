;POSSIBLE MESSAGES

;hello -- Used to initialize three-way handshake; client->server.
;welcome -- Lets client know server got "hello"; server->client.
;thanks -- Tells server that client is done logging in; client->server.
;goodbye -- Tells client that its connection to the server is gone; server->client.
;send-msg -- Informs server to send this message to another client; client->server.
;receive-msg -- Message to be received by client; server->client.
;logout -- Informs the server that the client is logging off; client->server.
;client-list -- List of clients logged into the server; server->client.
