1 orange, peeled, seeded, and diced
1 no. 2 can crushed pineapple, drained
rind of one lemon, grated
3 tablespoons chopped preserved ginger
2 five-oz cans water chestnuts, drained and coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons powdered mustard
2 teaspoons caraway seeds
3 teaspoons celery seeds
2 teaspoons poppy seeds
2 1/2 teaspoons oregano
1 crushed bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon mace
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon marjoram
1/2 teaspoon summer savory
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
3/4 teaspoon sage
3/4 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
5 cloves garlic, finely minced
6 large ribs celery, chopped
4 large onions, peeled and chopped
5 dashes Tabasco sauce
1 tablespoon salt
6 cups fresh bread crumbs, or 3 packages bread crumbs
3/4 pound ground veal
1/2 pound ground fresh pork or sausage
1/4 pound butter
1 16-pound to 20-pound turkey

In one bowl, combine the diced apple, orange, crushed pineapple,
lemon rind, ginger, and chopped water chestnuts.  Mix well.

In a second (huge) bowl, combine all the herbs and spices, the
parsley, garlic, celery, onions, Tabasco, and salt.  Toss well.

Add the remaining ingredients and the contents of the first bowl.
Blend everything well with the fingers.  Stuff the turkey and

stuffing may be frozen and used later for chickens, ducks, or
another turkey.  [Or just cooked on the stove and mixed in --BH]
