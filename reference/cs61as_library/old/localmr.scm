Three steps of map reduce:

1. apply mapper to each kv pair in input..
2. sort them into buckets  (sort-into-buckets)
3. run a reduce on each bucket (groupreduce)

This version internally operates on association lists, and
converts to and from stream as necesary to match the real
mapreduce.

NOTE: use this file for testing locally to weed out trivial errors. You will not
be able to answer parallelization questions just by using this code.

USAGE:
(lmapreduce <mapper> <reducer> <base-case> <input>)
<input> is either a stream of key-value pairs, or:
"/sample-emails" - a bunch of emails keyed by a single key, sample-emails
"/beatles-songs" - beatles song titles keyed by album
These are NOT the same as what the real mapreduce uses (obviously, much smaller)
