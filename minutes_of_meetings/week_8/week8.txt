Richard:
initially skeptical, but then found beauty
lexical scoping, dispatch
returning functions that you can call

all still a bit confused

Christian:
Enjoyed the book, watched the lectures, nested environments


Harun:
Week 9 is loads of fun

Umut:
nice chapter
extra for experts is the exercise with the let

Andrew:

confused about syntax

page 317
define (count) as opposed to define count

confused about difference between frame and environment
if I extend an environment with a frame, I'm creating a new environment

ask function really pretty
