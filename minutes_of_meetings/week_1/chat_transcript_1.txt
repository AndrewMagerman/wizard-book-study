As mentioned in one foodnote: Alan Perlis (paraphrasing Oscar Wilde) that ``Lisp programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.''

I believe Harold Abelson call that magic that happen in recursion: "wishful thinking"
(when I said Susskind, I was refering to Sussman, sorry)

it's not only functional; javascript has some ideas of Self, it's prototyped object programming. Where messages, resolve when a slot with a method definition is found in the hierarchy. Similar to dinamic scoping.
I think that a fair quantity of misunderstanding comes from there.
