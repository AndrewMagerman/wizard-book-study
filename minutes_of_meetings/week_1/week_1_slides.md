# Homework

- introducing labs, projects, exams

---
# Labs
> Laboratory exercises are short, relatively simple exercises designed to introduce a new topic. Most weeks you’ll do these during the scheduled lab meetings the first half of the week, in groups of two to four students.

---
# Homework
> Homework assignments consist mostly of exercises from the textbook; you’ll do these whenever you can schedule time, either in the lab or at home. 

---
# Homework
> You may be accustomed to textbooks with huge numbers of boring, repetitive exercises. You won’t find that in our text! Each assigned exercise teaches an important point. These assignments are included in the course reader.

---
# Projects
> Projects are larger assignments intended both to teach you the skill of developing a large program and to assess your understanding of the course material. 

---
# Projects
> There are four projects during the semester. The first two programming projects will be done individually. The last two projects are larger, and will be done in groups of two, but with each individual student responsible for specific problems within the project.

# Exams

We will also be taking these!
